# Business Card Jekyll Theme

To experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` â€“ this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!

## Installation

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: business-card-jekyll
```

or, in case you are using GitHub Pages, the line should be:

```yaml
remote_theme: J3-Tech/business-card-jekyll
```

## Usage

Add some or all of the following settings in the `_config.yml` file in order to configure your business card.
The majority of the settings are optional, while a few have predefined default values
(which can be overridden by assigning an empty string `""` as the value of that setting).

```yaml
# General settings
title:        Business Card theme

background:
  color:    rgb(43,42,51)

foreground:
  color:    whitesmoke

# Card info
card:
  name:       John Doe
  titles:     Software Engineer | Student

# Profiles
profiles:
  github:         octocat
  youtube:        user/YouTube
  twitter:        twitter
